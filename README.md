### Hi there 👋

I'm a Web Developer based in 🍁 Toronto🏒 with a bachelor in mechanical engineering and a minor in business.

My focus area for the past year has been front-end development with React, building components to help startups with their launches.

I love building clean, usable and accessible UIs, both on the user-facing and dev-facing sides. I enjoy working in agile teams with fast, ever-improving processes. I'm great at working with very little instructions, asking questions and finding loose ends.

I'm looking for a collaborative, cross-functional team where I can continue growing my career, learning from those around me and having fun while we build great features together


- 🌱 I’m currently improving in Javascript, REACT, Node.js, and Express
