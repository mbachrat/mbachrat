### Hi there 👋

I'm a Web Developer based in 🍁 Toronto🏒 with a bachelor in mechanical engineering and a minor in business.

I love building clean, usable and accessible UIs, both on the user-facing and dev-facing sides. I enjoy working in agile teams with fast, ever-improving processes.

I'm looking for a collaborative, cross-functional team where I can continue growing my career, learning from those around me and having fun while we build great features together


- 🌳 I’m currently improving in Typescript, React, NEXT.js, Node.js, and Express
